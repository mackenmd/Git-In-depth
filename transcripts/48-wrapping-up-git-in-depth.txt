>> Nina: Finally, the slide you've all been waiting for. It's the end. We're done. We have done a massive whirlwind tour of git, we've talked about how to make your repository neat and clean with rebase, we've talked about best practices, like not pushing change history to shared repositories. We have learned how do you fix our mistakes when we mess up.

And I think at this point, after today, you can truly consider yourself a GIT master. So I am going to congratulate you on that, but also feel slightly sorry for you because now you are the person in the office that everyone is going to come to when they have GIT questions, so thank you so much for your time.

There is some extra material in the slides and a few extra exercises. So if you'd like to, you can go ahead and check those out. I am going to end up posting a shorter version of the slides after today. Thank you all so much.
