>> Nina Zakharenko: Now, Git Revert is the safe reset. What if you need to undo changes that are shared, they're public, you push them? Git Revert is going to create a new commit that introduces the opposite changes from the specified commit. The original commit is going to stay in the repository.

And revert does not change history. So here, I'm picking a commit to undo. And when I Git Revert it, Git is going to create a new commit that is the mirror opposite of the one that you specified.
